# Aquaponics System Control

This is a simple web application that allows you to control an aquaponics system. It provides a user interface to toggle various components of the system and view system parameters such as water level, temperature, and pH level.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install microdot pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare a CSV file named `state.csv` to store the system state.
   - The CSV file should have the following columns: `water_pump`, `air_pump`, `light`, `water_level`, `temperature`, and `pH_level`.
   - You can initialize the CSV file with default values or leave it empty, and the program will create it if it doesn't exist.

2. Run the `app.py` file:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8008`.
   - You will see the aquaponics system control interface displaying the current state and parameters.

4. Use the provided buttons to toggle the components ON or OFF:
   - Water Pump
   - Air Pump
   - Light

5. You can also set the system parameters manually by modifying the input fields:
   - Water Level
   - Temperature
   - pH Level

6. The system state and parameters will be saved to the `state.csv` file automatically.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- microdot - a micro web framework for Python.
- pandas - a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

## CSV File Format

The `state.csv` file stores the system state and parameters. It should have the following columns:

- `water_pump` - represents the status of the water pump ('ON' or 'OFF').
- `air_pump` - represents the status of the air pump ('ON' or 'OFF').
- `light` - represents the status of the light ('ON' or 'OFF').
- `water_level` - represents the water level in the system.
- `temperature` - represents the temperature of the system.
- `pH_level` - represents the pH level of the system.
