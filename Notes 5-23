Artificial life is a field of study wherein researchers examine systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution
Langton's ant - two-dimensional universal Turing machine
Digital organism is a self-replicating computer program that mutates and evovles.
Digital organisms are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Da
Simlife - creators of dinosaur experiments
Artificial living plants - factory living animal contraption
Automated spacecraft capable of constructing copies of itself was first proposed in 1974 by computational scientist
Astrochicken 1970 - one-kilogram spacecraft unlike any before it
John von Neumann mathematics - mathematical biology, numeric microorganisms
Goal- design a machine whose complexity could grow automatically, self replication
Mutation inherited in later generations
- mutation add ons
Plant vs digital plant cut in half - pattern structures are similar
Simulation on how biology patterns are formed
Emergence - ex. teamwork with ants - big goal in a.i - how do cells do it?
Netlogo - flocking - ant piles - termites - flower Simulation - sandpile
Bee comunication , sea turtles (emergence)
O2p- Orbium Phantasma - math problem
Lenia-mathemaical life form, expanded universe
Alien gpu life - twin worlds, planet Gaia
Self deploying machines, replicating triangles, toxic loops - Simulating diseases?
Digital Whiteboard?
How do we build an ecosystem ?- simulation
How does life arise from the nonliving? - big idea
What are the potentials and limits of living systems?
How is life related to mind,machines and culture?
